# Driving-Behavior-Prediction

My capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

**Topic:** EEG data for Mental Attention State Detection

## Dataset

The training and testing datasets for the Mental State Detection Challenge can be downloaded from [Kaggle's competition webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/inancigdem/eeg-data-for-mental-attention-state-detection/data#).

## Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (v0.21)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
